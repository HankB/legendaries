# First Community Day

Woof! This was crazy, grueling and a blast.

## TL;DR

My goal at present is to lovel up. I'm at 38 right now since starting in late December. To do that I catch as many Pokemon as I can and raid as often as I can (using the free passes, for the most part.) I also complete the various research assignments. Here's what I got from this event:

### Legendaries

* 1 Lugia (trade that turned out lucky)
* 2 OG Giratina
* 1 altered forme Giratina
* 1 Dialga
* 2 Groudon
* 2 Kyogre
* 1 shiny Kyogre (traded)
* 1 Regigigas (traded)

### Shadow legendaries

From defeating Grunt leaders and Giovanni

* Moltres
* Zapdos
* Articuno
* Mewtwo

Used Charge-TM to renove Frustration from all of the above. They have pretty good IVs so I plan to not purify for now.

Shinies caught during the event

* Swablu (my first)
* Chansey (first)
* Clamperl (first)
* Sableye (first)
* Charmander with pikachu visor)
* Magikarp (3rd?)
* Shadow Pinsir (rescued fron Giovanni at 8:00 PM Sunday.)

## Prep

I did this with our kids who got me started on PoGo. They've been playing for a while. Both level 40, lots of XP, stardust, rare candy and so on. My son shot me a list of his legendaries and it starts out like this

```text
10(2) Articuno
9(4) Zapdos
10(4) Moltres
15(1) Mewtwo (some with Psystrike)
```

and goes on for another 30 or so lines. My collection is a bit smaller. ;) They've been helping me with getting off to a decent start and one aspect is trading. We've been catching a bunch of random Rhyhorn since we last visited and I've been hanging on to them to trade. I traded 8 or 10 Rhyhorn with my daughter-in-law and got three lucky trades! Before we finished we also got a lucky trade for a Karrablast and Corphish. Off to a great start! (On our last visit I got a lucky trade on a Chansy.) But best is yet to come. Later in the evening - just before midnight really - I had gotten some images of the comet and minutes before midnight I traded my son a Larvitar for a Lugia and that came out lucky too! I have another lucky Legendary to build up. We kept my meager hoard of Stardust (~450K) and coin (~600) to hold for the Go Fest to see what it cold be best spent on.

The kids live on a few acres outside a small town in Michigan. They're bout a mile from the closest stop and miles from gyms. But they usually have about a dozen Pokemon available for couch catching.

## Day One

We We went into town and were spinning, raiding and catching as we walked around. I was pleased to see all the little blue men and caught all that I could. And a few Gible and some others. We were able to take advantage of the bonuses by stacking with lucky eggs and star pieces to maximize my return. It was interesting to see the mix of Pokemon change hour by hour. And I caught my first shimy Swablu right off the bat. I caught a total of three shinies on the first day (Swablu, Chansey and Clamperl.) These are all shinies I didn't have. The Chansey was immediately put to work defending a gym. :)

I can't give more detial than that because by the end of the day I was wiped out.

### Raids

Kyogre - my first encounter! We found enough trainers to raid and I had my first go at capturing one. He fled. :( But we raided Kyogre two more times and I caught both! On a later Kyogre raid (that I didn't participate in due to lack of passes) my son caught a shiny. He now has over a dozen, including 5 shinies. Last night we did another specisl trade and he traded me a shiny Kyogre so I now have three including one shiny. We also raided Groudon and I caught one. Later in the day I got an invite for a remote raid on another Groudon and caught that one too. They were both 3* and weather boosted and so much better than the level 15 Groudon I received from a reaearch assignment. (I got numerous invites to raid remotely and was not able to due to insufficient remote passes.)

Hourly challenges - these broke up the day and gave us something to look forward to. And something to focus on. Without that, the day would have ben a total blur. We did head "home" for lunch which was nice and due to the decentralized nature of the event, we were able to continue playing even without gyms or stops nar by. Our son lives out in the coutry and the nearest stop is about a mile away. Nevertheless, he gets terrific spawns. In Winfield I usually have 2 or 3 Pokemon available for couch catching. He has about a dozen at any given time. We can count o catching several Rhyhorn a day and even a Larvitar or Bagon on a daily basis. (Just missed a Larvitar that despawned while we were having dinner.) Even with the hourly challenges the way wore on and we were happy to finish at 8:00.

## Day Two

Our son researched what we were going to face and showed me how to construct a fighting team and dragon team for the 5T raids. We also establshed that the Rocket teams had been nerfed conpared to what they were before the event. I was happy about that since I had found Giovanni difficult and didn't seem to have what was needed to counter Sierra's Lapras. We started at home and then headed to town for more raids and to catchg more Pokemon. I caught a Dialga, 2 OG Giratina, one Altered Forme Giratina and a Palkia. Except for the Altered Forme they were all 3*. By early afternoon I had completed all assignments and captured all of the shadow legendaries. We headed home for a late lunch/snack. We continued playing, capturing the yard Pokemon (I recall 2 Alolan Exeggutor almost all the time as well as the occasional Lervitar of Gible.) I also went after the near continuous stream of balloons. The last one was Giovanni and came minutes before the 8:00 PM close. I defeated him and was rewarded with a shadow shiny Pinsir.

Later that evening we did some more trading and I got a lucky Litwik, Sandshrew and Elekid. My daughter-in-law also traded me a Regigas and my son gave me a shiny Squirtle with sunglasses, but neither trade turned lucky.

## Worth it?

Go Fest was the firest time I put real $$$ into PoGo. Was it worth it? Heck yeah! It also gave us an excuse to visit the kids in Michigan and stop by our favorite fruit stand at the Coloma exit on I-94.
